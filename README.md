The Array Min and Max Finder is a Python program that efficiently finds the minimum and maximum values in an array. By iterating through the array, it compares each element with the current minimum and maximum. The program first initializes the min and max variables to the first element of the array. Then, as it traverses the array, it updates the min and max values whenever a smaller or larger value is found. This program provides an optimal solution to determine the smallest and largest numbers in an array using Python. It's a basic yet essential skill for handling numerical data.
